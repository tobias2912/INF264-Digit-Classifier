# Project 3
On this project Tobias Sletvold Eilertsen(tei024) and Ingrid Liabakk Eriksen(ier008) worked together. We split the work 50/50.

### Design choices:
Folder structure: 

    Input data: /data/

    Python files: /src/

    Main file: /src/main.py

# summary
This project is to create a machine learning model for classifying hand-written digits.

# Technical report

## preprocessing steps
- normalizing

## algorithms
- use the classifiers hyperparameters

## performance measure
Measure accuracy in percentage of correct predictions. Because it's either right or wrong and diviation from correct is not important. 

## model selection scheme
- grid search

## chosen model
- random forest
- k-neigbors
- linear svc 
- bagging 

## expected performance

## overfitting
- cross validation


## possible improvements
